                Gender Vs Gender is a project that I have developed to address the issue of sexist and
                gender-based stereotypes. The concept emerged from the recognition that individuals of both genders can
                experience physical and mental harm as a result of gender stereotypes. Regrettably, contemporary society
                often exacerbates the issue by creating a false dichotomy between genders.

                To raise awareness about this important issue, I created an Instagram page that emulates the style of a
                motivational quote page. However, in contrast to typical motivational quotes, the posts on Gender Vs
                Gender
                serve to challenge gender stereotypes and promote gender equality.

                <span class="badge bg-info text-dark">Why this is Important:</span>

                If I can spread the word about the trauma and evilness that is spread through sexism and gender-based
                stereotypes now, then maybe in the future when Gen Z and Millenials are having children we can begin
                correcting the mistakes made by the older generations. These types of issues affect everyone and no one
                deserves to be the victim of sex-based aggression.

                <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">Gender Vs Gender Disclaimer:</span>
                Additionally, I would like to note that I am using the term gender rather than
                sex
                but I am aware people can identify with any gender or sex role they like other than the two basic ones
                that I cover on this site.


                I named my Instagram page gendervsgender because that is exactly what I am fighting against. The world
                doesnâ€™t have to be men and women pinned against each other, it should be humans helping one another.

                        <p class="card-text">Hi. My name is Liv Workman, I am a Sophomore here at Miami University
                            majoring in ETBD with a minor in General Business. I
                            come from a small town called Newark Ohio where I attended a fairly conservative school
                            system for a large majority of my life. Now after leaving that town my eyes are more open
                            then ever before to how truely messed up the world is. I want to do everything in my power
                            to make this world a better place. Starting small of course, with things like this project
                            which draws attention to the evils of gender based stereotypes and how they can effect our
                            mental health. I identify as she/ her, a sister, a daughter, a partner, a friend, a cousin,
                            a neice, a granduaghter and a creator. I hope you can learn something from this piece.</p>
