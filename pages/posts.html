                                but men have emotions, feelings and desires like the rest of us. There are plenty of
                                women out there that only desire sex and there are plenty of men out there who desire
                                deep meaningful relationships. Condemning and entire gender seems a bit harsh.

                                <strong>Women Can't Help Themselves.</strong> Growing up in the early 2000's I was told
                                that a princess needed to be saved by a princess and that these women were damsels in
                                destress. To some extent this idea still lingers today. For example sometimes when I am
                                at work a man (although just trying to help) will try to take something out of my hands
                                because it appears heavy. To them because I am a woman I need to be saved from this
                                dangerous task. Which of course is not true. Another example would be when a woman is
                                having car trouble and a man thinks that it is his responsibilty to input himself into
                                the situation. Both genders have their issues and everyone needs to be saved or assisted
                                at some point.

                                <strong>The Ideal Woman.</strong> This one has layers, the first being that this is how
                                society collectively believes women should look. Skinny, well proportioned with stunning
                                features. So not only do men tend to look for women such as the one in the picture but
                                women feel pressure to look like the woman in the picture. The deepest layer of all is
                                about eating disorders. It is no secret that many young women struggle with eating
                                disorders. It is less obvious that a lot of men can also struggle with eating disorders
                                and body dismorphia. They just try to mask it more because men "aren't supposed to be
                                insecure, they should be confident."

                                <strong>What are We Teaching Kids?</strong> The reason why these hidden societal issues
                                go unnoticed is because they have always been there. We picked up on gender stereotypes
                                and bias as kids. It is all we have ever known which makes it harder to see what is
                                wrong with it. As kids we were told things like blue is for boys and pink is for girls.
                                Or dolls are for girls and toy cars are for boys. Science is for boys and art is for
                                girls. All of these factors influence who we are today. Sadly the negative effects of
                                sticking gendered children into metaphorical boxes still lingers.

                                woman president is because women are just too emotional and her emotionals could get the
                                United States into a lot of trouble. Well in one of my classes last semseter we talked
                                and read about how are exspected to show emotion through saddness while men are
                                exspected to show emotion through anger. Men are viewed as strong and reliable while
                                women are viewed as unstable. Both genders are equally emotional but the way that
                                society has trained each gender to express their emotions is extremely different. No one
                                should be shamed for their feelings. We should all be allowed to express and communicate
                                our emotions.

                                <strong>Hoes, Sluts and Humans.</strong> Women are often depicted in media (that is
                                targeted towards men) as being very sexualized. If it is known that a woman has slept
                                with even one partner they can be called a slut or a whore. However if a man is known to
                                have slept with a woman he is congradulated. The idea that one gender is praised for
                                partaking in sexual pleasure while the other is shunned simply isn't right. Sex is a
                                natural part of being a human and no matter what your religous beliefs are there is no
                                reason to shame anyone about their sexual expirences.

                                to stay home to keep house and raise kids. They want to have a full time career where
                                they can persue their passions as well has help provide for their family. Additionally
                                men are also welcome to be stay at home parents.

                                <strong>Men Don't Have To Provide</strong> This post was also inspired by the 1950's
                                strong urge for men to remain the breadwinners and masters of the house. It was a way to
                                control women and although it may seem like those days are far behind us a bit of that
                                sexism still lingers. It is one thing for a woman to be a stay at home parent on her own
                                accord. Yet sometimes society shame women, especially mothers for not giving up their
                                careers. I am sure you have heard the horror stories of women who become so financially
                                dependent on their spouses that they can't afford to leave an abusive situation.
                                Marriage is a partnership, their doesn't need to be a master.

                                <strong>You Aren't Tough Enough</strong> Football, baseball, basketball. Are all sports
                                reserved most of the time for men. Society says that these sports are too dangerous for
                                women or that we are not strong enough to play with the boys. At the same time whenever
                                one of these male players shows any sign of pain or weakness they are told to walk it
                                off, it's not that bad. It wasn't until very recently that I have seen a shift in the
                                way injuries are treated during sports. That doesn't mean that encouraging men to

                                Kitchen" is a phrase that I am tired of hearing. To be completely honest with you my
                                father cooks way better then my mother ever did and my boyfriend cooks far better then I
                                ever could. Cooking should not be gendered. It is a basic part of survival, everyone
                                should be able or allowed to cook. No one should be expected to do just based off of
                                their gender.

                                <strong>Games Are For The Boys</strong> You know, video games being targeted at boys
                                seems like a very large missed oppurtunity for video game design companies. The industry
                                made it seem like video games were meant for one gender for so long, how did they not
                                see that they were missing out on a huge profit area. Anyway that is not the main point
                                of this post. The point is that it is a common issue where some men will tune out their
                                significant other while playing video games and get truely upset when they try to draw
                                their attention away from the game. Why this agression or phenomenon started I have no
                                clue but it is not a healthy way to handle things. Also not all men have this issue and
                                the ones that do tend to have other sexist tendencies as well.

                                <strong>Sports Vs School.</strong> Growing up I can remember that girls were expected to
                                get good grades while boys were exspected to focus on sports. In this case I used
                                strength to represent this idea. Even in my own home I was exspected to get good grades
                                and I was punished when I didn't recieve an A. However my brother would bring home C's
                                and D's and be told it was okay because he had sports to focus on. This message may be
                                why men don't feel enclined to become studious. Perhaps it is because societies message
                                to young boys was that they will never be smart so they might as well be strong. That is
                                not the message we should be teaching children.

                                <strong>Yes but No.</strong> Although I understand where this phrase originated from I
                                don't believe it is entirely fair. Anyone, no matter age, race or gender has the
                                capacity to be dangerous. Condemning and entire gender to be dangerous is a bit of an
                                overstep. Instead I would argue that anyone could be dangerous. Yes I understand that
                                human trafficing has risen over the last couple of years and we hear more stories about
                                men abusing women then we do women abusing men but that doesn't mean all men are
                                dangerous. Women partake in human trafficing too. And women can also be abusers. In
                                additon to that idea that women can be abusive, often times when a man comes furth
                                saying that he has been mistreated and abused society will often think that he is lying
                                or that it can't be that bad. This is another example of society supressing male
                                emotions.

                                <strong>Women Can't Drive?</strong> Again, I am not sure where this idea originated but
                                it condemes half of the population to not being able to do something that nearly
                                everyone in the U.S. does on a daily basis. That is like saying men can't brush their
                                teeth. The idea that women can't drive is just as outdated as the "women belong in the
                                kitchen" line. Anyone can be a good or a bad driver reguardless of gender. My best guess
                                as to why the idea of women not being about to drive came to be is because cars are not/
                                were not designed for women so it made it harder for them to opperate.

                                <strong>Women Can't Use Tools?</strong> This one I thought was a bit funny. Again, why
                                is the task of fixing things devoted to one gender? Last time I checked women are jsut
                                as capible as men. However whenever something breaks in my expirence if a woman tries to
                                fix it then a man will take the tool out of her hand and say that they will fix it. The
                                funny part is that most of the time in my case the man failed and the women suceeded. I
                                am not saying that means that women are more capible then men. I am saying that we are
                                more capible then what some people believe.

                                <strong>Women Who Stay At Home Don't Have Money Anyway.</strong> Why did the idea that a

                                trick men into buying them stuff. (lol) Either way this societal rule has no ethical
                                standing. It is nice when someone offers to pay for dinner or a movie but their gender
                                shouldn't decide for them that they have to. We are living in a time when women and men
                                work. Personal opinion, the person that asked for the date/ outing should pay unless a
                                discussion has taken place for other arangements. Gender should not decide who has to
                                open their wallet. (Keep in mind that you can split the bill as well.)

                                so I thought that I would throw a little bit of a reminder in here that most women these
                                days go to college to start a career, not to find a "master provider husband."

                                ideas and I thought well, pink is associated with girls and blue with boys. Then I
                                thought fancy cursive and nice handwritting is thought of as more feminine will sports
                                type block letters are thought of as more masculine. Hence the creation of the profile
