                        independent at a young age. To add to her thick skin Camryn is a member of the LGBTQ+ community

                    <p class="card-text">Shance is a Junior here at Miami majoring in Computer Science. He is an
                        extremely smart man from an extremely smart family. His mother is from Japan and his father was
                        in the U.S. Military. Shance was actualy born on Japanese soil but is a natural born U.S.
                        citizen. He grew up in California with a bit of a tramatic childhood then moved to Maryland
                        around late middle school where he said he had to learn how to fit in all over again. In general
                        Shance
                        leans more on the side of a "traditional man" he is concerned with his hiehgt
                        and his looks but when questioned about it he shuts down and says he doesn't actually care. He
                        also is a firm believer that a woman should be taken care of by the man and not the other way
                        around, especially financially. However he is the type of person who will drop anything to come
                        help you when you need it. He trys not to show it but he cares for his friends and family very
                        deeply which I believe scares him. Additonally Shance is currently a member of the U.S. Marine
                        Corps. </p>

                        work but she is enrolled in online college classes where she is studying Website Creation. In
                        the 6 months she has been in the hospital 3 tiumes for surgrey yet she doesn't let the pain get
                        her down. She is a happy, funny and caring person. She cares for her mother but has a tense
                        relationship with her at some point due to her mothers very strict personality. Skylers younger
                        brother also suffers from severe mental health issues which she believes need to be treated but
                        her mother refuses to get him therapy. Skyler moved back in with her mother, brother and step
                        father around the time of the covid-19 outbreak to save money. As mentioned her mother is a very
                        strict Christian woman who often tries to control Skylers decisions. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Zach is the final member of the hometown and same high school group. He was
                    originally enrolled at Ohio State Newark branch but issues arose with finances so he no longer
                    attends college and moved down to Oxford to be with his friends. He is extremely smart although he
                    doesn't often use his full potential. He is currently working as a line cook at Gaslight Brewhouse
                    where Anthony and I also work. Zach grew up in the same small town as Anthony, James and I. He has a
                    very loving and caring mother and a "crazy" father who seperated when he was young. Zach notes
                    sometimes that he doesn't like the person that he used to be because he was slightly racist,
                    homophobic and sexist. He claims this was in part due to our small town but also his family members.
                    By the time I had meet Zach he was slightly consservative but still believed strongly in things such
                    as womens rights and equitable pay. In his freetime he is either talking on the phone with his long distance girlfriend Skyler, gaming or hanging out with his friends.</p>
